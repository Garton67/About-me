    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p> 
        I am a veteran. I served four years in the Navy as an aviation maintenance administrator for a F/A-18 Hornet Squadron. After the service, I earned an associate's degree in instrumentation. I have been working in various chemical plants in the Houston area for the last two years while learning to code in my free time. I am excited to be here and I am determined to break into the tech industry as a web developer.
